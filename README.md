# MLWorkshop

The data, genres_original, and audio_samples directories contain the FMA data, which is not uploaded to GitHub due to their size. The spectrograms directory fills up with files when running CNN_spectrogram_classifier.ipynb.

The requirements.txt file contains all of the necessary packages to run the .ipnyb files.

The CNN_spectrogram_classifier.ipynb file is used for training and testing the CNN model on audio files.

The SVM_feature_classifier.ipynb file is used for training and testing various machine learning classification models on audio feature data.
